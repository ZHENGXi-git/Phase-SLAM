# Phase-SLAM
### A Pose Estimator for Dense Reconstruction with the Structured Light Illumination Sensor

This open source is written by MATLAB 

### Run Mode

Open one of the Name_00xU.m or Name_00xR.m by matlab,  for example David_001U.m (each of them corresponds to a dataset), and run it.

The reconstruciton results is shown in fig:
