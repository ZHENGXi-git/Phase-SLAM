# Phase-SLAM
### A Pose Estimator for Dense Reconstruction with the Structured Light Illumination Sensor

This open source is written by MATLAB 

### Run Mode

* Open one of the Name_00xU.m or Name_00xR.m by MATLAB,  for example David_001U.m (each of them corresponds to a dataset).

* Run it.

* No other dependencies are required. 

The ground-truth models and reconstruction results are shown in fig:

The 
(a)-(c) are unreal datasets built in Unreal Engineer 4 simulator, (e)-(f) are real-world datasets collected by structured light sensor with UR5 robotic arm.
The bottom row is ground truth, the top row is result.
